====================

Disable Flat Rate if UPS offers a lower option

Example of how to use:
The client has both Flat Rate (the flat rate offered for order totals over a specified amount) and UPS active in the shop. Basically what I'm trying to accomplish is to NOT display the FLAT RATE shipping if ANY of the UPS shipping rates are LESS than $49.
