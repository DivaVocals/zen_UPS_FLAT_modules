Disable Flat Rate if UPS offers a lower option

Example of how to use:
The client has both Flat Rate (the flat rate offered for order totals over a specified amount is $49) and UPS active in the shop. Basically what I'm trying to accomplish is to NOT display the FLAT RATE shipping if ANY of the UPS shipping rates are LESS than $49.
